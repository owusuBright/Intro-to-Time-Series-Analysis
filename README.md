# Introduction to Time Series Analysis
This project introduces the basics of time series analysis, such as stationarity, autocorrelation, and forecasting, using Python. Time series analysis is a branch of statistics that deals with data that are ordered in time, such as stock prices, weather data, or sales data. The goal of time series analysis is to understand the patterns and trends in the data, and to make predictions based on the past behavior.

# Data
The data used in this project are from the Yahoo Finance, which contains various time series data from different domains.

# Tools
The tool used in is project are Python, a popular programming language for data analysis. It is used to perform data manipulation, preprocessing, and visualization, using libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. It is also used to perform statistical analysis, modeling, and forecasting. 

# Results
The results of this project are displayed in various plots and tables, showing the characteristics and features of the time series data, such as trend, seasonality, autocorrelation, stationarity, and outliers. The results also show the performance and accuracy of different forecasting method.
